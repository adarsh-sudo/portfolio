Work :-
1. Integrated Amazon S3 with Django using boto3 and
S3Boto3Storage for secure file handling, and implemented
dynamic CloudFront signed URLs to protect media content
2. Enhanced the Django admin panel by adding inline editing, search
functionality, and optimized list displays for efficient management
of model fields.
3. Developed core APIs for the Databrewery labeling platform,
resolving both existing and newly reported bugs. Built and
integrated APIs to support platform functionality, including
iframe-based embedding for seamless integration
4. Implemented session-based project ID storage, streamlining API
calls by eliminating explicit ID passing across requests
5. Developed a robust filtering system using Django FilterSet and
PostgreSQL TrigramSimilarity, enabling intelligent project search
with fuzzy ranking
6. Built an order management system using Django Templates and
DRF, allowing admins to create language-specific orders with
scripts and other project details. Orders appear as assigned
projects in the labeling platform, enabling artists to view them,
upload language-specific audio, and track milestone progress
